- ADT can have virtual and unchanged functions; concrete class can add data and other methods (but can't be extending to further sublasses without modification)
- Data elements are all ADT type; User specifies which concrete class to use by which "...Create" method is called and needs to manually manage this (i.e. there is nothing the compiler can see that will tell it or the user later on in the code if a specific object is of one concrete type or another)
