# Comparison of OOP techniques in C

A collection of ways to use OOP techniques in C, organized from least to most complicated. Each folder demonstrates and briefly describes a different technique which (mostly) build upon one another.

The complexity starts to skyrocket after Project 3c, so that's probably the last one I would consider using in any of my projects (if I have to debug something, I want it to be the thing I'm trying to build, not the framework I'm relying on to work). This limits any OOP-style programming to just abstract data types (as opposed to a full inheritance structure), but so far I haven't found a strong need for the latter. In fact, we only need the projects leading up to and including 3c to demonstrate three different design patterns (Mediator, Template Method, and Factory).
