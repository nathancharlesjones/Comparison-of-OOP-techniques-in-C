# Run-time Polymorphism (Inheritable, No type checking)

- Variation on Project 4 to demonstrate that simply changing all public data types to "void *" is sufficient to achieve a fully inheritable version of run-time polymorphism with no explicit casting needed. **HOWEVER**, the use of "void *" intentionally circumvents the type-checking in C, meaning that any small error could have weird and disastrous consequences. For example, the function "duckShow" is expecting the input argument, though it is defined as "void *", to be of type "Duck" (or of some class derived from "Duck"). It assumes this always holds, blithely casting the input argument to type "Duck" and dereferencing it without any check that the argument IS of type "Duck". If the argument were something else, another object or a random pointer to int, then the program very quickly errors out, as badly as if a buffer had been overwritten or the stack blown out. It assumes that the input argument is a double-pointer to a Duck_Interface_Struct and treats the memory values at those locations as if they were valid function pointers, which they may not be.
- The only obvious recourse, to me, is to create our own form of type-checking to, at a minimum, see if our input arguments are of the type we expected them to be. Doing so requires a bit more work than shown here and is discussed in full in [Project 5a](https://github.com/nathancharlesjones/Comparison-of-OOP-techniques-in-C/tree/main/5a_Run-time-Polymorphism_Inheritable_No-casting).
