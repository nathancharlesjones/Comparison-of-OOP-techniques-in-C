- Miro Samek's OOP, part 1&2 (with private header files)
- Requires breaking encapsulation (subclasses NEED to be able to see the full definition of the parent struct)
    - Some encapsulation retained by using private header files, though
- Not true polymorphism, since the object has to be explicitly cast to the correct type
